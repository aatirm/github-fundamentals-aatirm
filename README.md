Hey, this is  Aatir Mustafa and this is a little bit about me!
I am a 27 year old chemistry student at McMaster univeristy who has an older autistic brother, a younger sister and a loving father, and is just trying to navigate and get through these next couple of weeks of schooling as I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and I just want to be able to finish my degree and move on to the next phase of my life from this one, that has lasted for the last 7 years after the passing of my mom to breast cancer. the road to this point has been long, hard, arduous and pain stakingly slow, but I am always optimistic in my faith of good energy and kindness of people to help get us all to the finish line.
